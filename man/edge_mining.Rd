\title{Edge Mining of Gene Interactions Using PubMed}
\usage{
edge_mining(
  predicted_list,
  ground_truth,
  delay = 0.5,
  query_field = "Title/Abstract"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predicted_list}{A list of predicted gene adjacency matrices. Each matrix must have row names
and column names representing gene names.}

\item{ground_truth}{A ground truth gene adjacency matrix (0/1) with row names and column names.}

\item{delay}{Numeric. The delay in seconds between consecutive PubMed queries to avoid overwhelming
the NCBI servers. Default is 0.5.}

\item{query_field}{Character. The PubMed search field to be used in the query (e.g., "Title/Abstract").
Default is "Title/Abstract".}
}
\value{
A list of data frames, one for each predicted matrix. Each data frame contains:
\describe{
\item{gene1}{The first gene in the gene pair.}
\item{gene2}{The second gene in the gene pair.}
\item{pubmed_hits}{The number of PubMed hits returned for the gene pair.}
\item{PMIDs}{A comma-separated string of PubMed IDs associated with the hits (or \code{NA} if none).}
}
}
\description{
This function compares predicted gene adjacency matrices to a ground truth matrix,
identifies gene pairs that are predicted as interacting (value 1) but are absent (value 0)
in the ground truth, and then queries PubMed for literature evidence of interactions between
these gene pairs. For each pair, it returns the number of PubMed hits and the associated PubMed IDs.
}
\details{
The function identifies discrepant gene pairs where the predicted matrix indicates an interaction (1)
but the ground truth does not (0). For each discrepant pair, a query is constructed and sent to PubMed
using the \code{rentrez} package. The query first retrieves the count of hits and, if hits are found,
a second query is made to retrieve all PubMed IDs. A delay is introduced between queries to comply with
NCBI usage guidelines.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load predicted matrices and ground truth from CSV files (example):
predicted1 <- as.matrix(read.csv("predicted_matrix1.csv", row.names = 1))
predicted2 <- as.matrix(read.csv("predicted_matrix2.csv", row.names = 1))
ground_truth <- as.matrix(read.csv("ground_truth.csv", row.names = 1))

# Combine predicted matrices into a list
predicted_list <- list(matrix1 = predicted1, matrix2 = predicted2)

# Run the edge mining function
result <- edge_mining(predicted_list, ground_truth, delay = 0.5, query_field = "Title/Abstract")

# View the result for the first matrix
print(result[[1]])
