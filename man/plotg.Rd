\title{Plot Multiple Graphs from Adjacency Matrices}
\usage{
plotg(adj_matrix_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrix_list}{A list of adjacency matrices, where each matrix represents
an undirected graph. The function assumes that the matrices are symmetric and
have zeros on the diagonal (no self-loops).}
}
\value{
A combined plot grid of all graphs generated from the adjacency matrices.
Each graph is visualized with nodes and edges, and the title includes the graph's index,
number of nodes, and number of edges.
}
\description{
This function generates and visualizes graphs from a list of adjacency matrices.
Each adjacency matrix is converted into an \code{igraph} object and plotted using the
\code{ggraph} package with a force-directed layout. The generated plots are then
arranged in a grid for easy comparison.
}
\details{
Each adjacency matrix in \code{adj_matrix_list} is processed individually, converting it
into an \code{igraph} object. The graphs are then visualized using the \code{ggraph} package, which
employs a force-directed layout for graph visualization. The title of each plot displays the
graph index and basic graph statistics (number of nodes and edges). All individual graphs are
arranged into a grid layout, with the number of columns dynamically determined by the square root
of the total number of graphs.
}
\note{
This function requires the following packages:
\itemize{
\item \code{igraph}
\item \code{ggraph}
\item \code{gridExtra}
}

If any of these packages are not installed, the function will stop and display an error message.

\examples{
# Example adjacency matrices (binary, undirected)
adj_matrix_1 <- matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
adj_matrix_2 <- matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Create a list of adjacency matrices
adj_matrices <- list(adj_matrix_1, adj_matrix_2)

# Call the plotg function to visualize the graphs
plotg(adj_matrices)
