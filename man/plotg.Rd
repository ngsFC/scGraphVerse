\title{Visualize Graphs from Adjacency Matrices}
\usage{
plotg(adj_matrix_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrix_list}{A list of square, symmetric adjacency matrices
with zeros on the diagonal (no self-loops). Each matrix represents an
undirected graph.}
}
\value{
A grid of plots displaying all valid graphs in the input list.
}
\description{
Generates and arranges multiple graph visualizations from a list of
adjacency matrices. Each matrix is converted into an undirected
\pkg{igraph} object and visualized using a force-directed layout via
\pkg{ggraph}.
}
\details{
Each adjacency matrix is validated to ensure it is square and
symmetric. Disconnected nodes (degree zero) are removed prior to
visualization. Graphs are visualized with a force-directed layout
using \pkg{ggraph}, and multiple plots are arranged into a grid with
\pkg{gridExtra}.

Each subplot title includes the graph index, number of nodes, and
number of edges.
}
\note{
This function requires the following packages:
\pkg{igraph}, \pkg{ggraph}, and \pkg{gridExtra}. If any are missing,
an informative error will be thrown.
