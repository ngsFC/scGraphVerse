\title{Create a Consensus Adjacency Matrix from Multiple Networks}
\usage{
create_consensus(
  adj_matrix_list,
  method = "vote",
  weighted_list = NULL,
  theta = 0.04,
  threshold = 0.5,
  ncores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_matrix_list}{A list of binary adjacency matrices (square, 0/1) with identical dimensions and row/column names.}

\item{method}{Character string indicating the consensus strategy. One of:
\itemize{
\item{\code{"vote"} (default):} An edge is included if present in at least \code{threshold} proportion of matrices.
\item{\code{"union"}:} An edge is included if present in at least one matrix.
\item{\code{"INet"}:} Uses normalized weighted adjacency matrices and calls \code{\link[INetTool]{consensusNet}}.
}}

\item{weighted_list}{A list of weighted adjacency matrices (required if \code{method = "INet"}).}

\item{theta}{Numeric. Tuning parameter passed to \code{consensusNet} (default: 0.04).}

\item{threshold}{Numeric in \link{0, 1}. Used for "vote" (fraction of matrices required to support an edge)
and "INet" (thresholding inside \code{consensusNet}). Default is 0.5.}

\item{ncores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use when method is \code{"INet"}. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A square consensus adjacency matrix (binary or weighted, depending on method).
}
\description{
This function builds a consensus adjacency matrix from a list of binary or weighted
adjacency matrices using one of three methods: \code{"vote"}, \code{"union"}, or \code{"INet"}.
}
\details{
The consensus is constructed differently depending on the selected method:
\describe{
\item{\strong{vote}}{Counts edge frequency across all matrices and includes edges present in at least \code{threshold Ã— N} matrices.}
\item{\strong{union}}{Includes any edge present in any matrix.}
\item{\strong{INet}}{Multiplies each binary matrix by its corresponding weighted matrix, normalizes values, and
combines networks using \code{\link[INetTool]{consensusNet}}.}
}
