\title{Generate Weighted and Binary Adjacency Matrices from BioGRID Data}
\usage{
BioGRID_Adj(top_genes, biogrid_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{top_genes}{A character vector of gene identifiers to filter the interactions.}

\item{biogrid_data}{A data frame containing BioGRID interaction data. The data should have
at least the columns \code{Interactor_A}, \code{Interactor_B}, and \code{Score}.}
}
\value{
A list containing two adjacency matrices:
\item{weighted}{A weighted adjacency matrix with interaction scores.}
\item{binary}{A binary adjacency matrix indicating the presence of interactions (1 or 0).}
}
\description{
This function creates weighted and binary adjacency matrices based on interactions
from BioGRID data for the provided list of genes.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
adj_matrices <- BioGRID_Adj(top_genes = c("GENE1", "GENE2"), biogrid_data = my_biogrid_data)
}
