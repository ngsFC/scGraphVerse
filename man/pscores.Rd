\title{Compute Performance Scores for Predicted Adjacency Matrices}
\usage{
pscores(ground_truth, predicted_list, zero_diag = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ground_truth}{A square binary adjacency matrix representing the
ground truth network. Values must be 0 or 1. Only the upper triangle is
used for evaluation.}

\item{predicted_list}{A list of predicted adjacency matrices to evaluate.
Each matrix must have the same dimensions and row/column names as
\code{ground_truth}.}

\item{zero_diag}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), sets the diagonal of
\code{ground_truth} to zero before evaluation, removing self-loops.}
}
\value{
A list with one element:\cr
\code{Statistics}: Data frame of evaluation metrics (TP, TN, FP, FN,
TPR, FPR, Precision, F1, MCC) for each predicted matrix.
}
\description{
Computes classification metrics by comparing predicted adjacency matrices
to a ground truth binary network and visualizes the performance via a
radar (spider) plot.
}
\details{
For each predicted matrix, the confusion matrix is computed
using the upper triangle (non-self edges). Metrics including True
Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), Precision, F1-score,
and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are calculated.

A radar plot is automatically generated summarizing the key scores
across matrices.
}
\note{
Requires the \pkg{fmsb}, \pkg{dplyr}, and \pkg{tidyr} packages.
