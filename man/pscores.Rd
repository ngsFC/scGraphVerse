\title{Compute Performance Scores for Predicted Adjacency Matrices}
\usage{
pscores(ground_truth, predicted_list, zero_diag = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ground_truth}{A square binary adjacency matrix representing the ground truth network.
Values must be 0 or 1. Only the upper triangle is used for evaluation.}

\item{predicted_list}{A list of predicted adjacency matrices to evaluate.
Each must have the same dimensions and row/column names as \code{ground_truth}.}

\item{zero_diag}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), sets the diagonal of \code{ground_truth} to zero
before evaluation, removing self-loops.}
}
\value{
A list with one element:
\itemize{
\item \code{Statistics}: A data frame containing evaluation metrics (TP, TN, FP, FN, TPR, FPR, Precision, F1, MCC)
for each predicted matrix.
}
}
\description{
Computes classification metrics by comparing predicted adjacency matrices
to a ground truth binary network. Visualizes the performance scores using a radar (spider) plot.
}
\details{
For each predicted matrix, the confusion matrix is computed using the upper triangle
(non-self edges). Metrics including True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR),
Precision, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are calculated.

A radar plot is automatically generated summarizing the key scores across matrices.
}
\note{
Requires the \pkg{fmsb}, \pkg{dplyr}, and \pkg{tidyr} packages.

\examples{
# Simulate ground truth and predictions
ground_truth <- matrix(sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10)
diag(ground_truth) <- 0
pred1 <- ground_truth
pred2 <- matrix(sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10)

# Compute scores and generate radar plot
result <- pscores(ground_truth, list(pred1, pred2))
result$Statistics
}
