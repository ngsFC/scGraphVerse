\title{Calculate performance metrics for predicted adjacency matrices against ground truth}
\usage{
pscores(ground_truth, predicted_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{ground_truth}{A square matrix representing the ground truth adjacency matrix. The diagonal
elements will be set to zero.}

\item{predicted_list}{A list of square matrices representing predicted adjacency matrices that
will be compared to the ground truth.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Statistics}: A data frame with the performance metrics (TP, TN, FP, FN, TPR, FPR, Precision,
F1, Accuracy) for each matrix in the \code{predicted_list}.
\item A bar plot displaying the comparison of metrics (TPR, FPR, F1, Precision, Accuracy)
across all matrices.
}
}
\description{
This function computes a variety of performance metrics (such as precision, recall, F1 score,
accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate) for a list of predicted adjacency matrices
by comparing them with a provided ground truth matrix. The function calculates metrics
for the upper triangular part of the adjacency matrices, excluding the diagonal.
It then creates a bar plot comparing the performance of each predicted matrix.
}
\details{
This function computes the following performance metrics:
\itemize{
\item \strong{True Positive Rate (TPR)}: The proportion of actual positive edges that were correctly
predicted (also known as recall).
\item \strong{False Positive Rate (FPR)}: The proportion of actual negative edges that were incorrectly
predicted as positive.
\item \strong{Precision}: The proportion of predicted positive edges that were actually positive.
\item \strong{F1 Score}: The harmonic mean of Precision and TPR.
\item \strong{Accuracy}: The proportion of correct predictions (TP + TN) to all predictions (TP + TN + FP + FN).
}

The function also excludes diagonal elements from both the ground truth and predicted matrices,
and operates only on the upper triangular part of the adjacency matrices (which represents the
directed edges).
