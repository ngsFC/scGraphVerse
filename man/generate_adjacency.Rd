\title{Generate Adjacency Matrices from Gene Interaction Tables}
\usage{
generate_adjacency(df_list, nCores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_list}{A list of data frames. Each data frame must have three
columns:
\describe{
\item{Gene1}{Character. First gene in the interaction.}
\item{Gene2}{Character. Second gene in the interaction.}
\item{Weight}{Numeric. Weight or strength of the interaction from
\code{Gene1} to \code{Gene2}.}
}}

\item{nCores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel
processing. Defaults to the number of available workers from the
current \pkg{BiocParallel} backend.}
}
\value{
A list of square numeric adjacency matrices. Each matrix has
genes as row and column names, and weights as values. Diagonal
entries are set to zero (no self-interactions).
}
\description{
Constructs adjacency matrices from a list of data frames, each
representing weighted geneâ€“gene interactions.
}
\details{
The function first identifies all unique genes across all data
frames to define the matrix dimensions. For each interaction table,
it places the corresponding weights at the appropriate gene-pair
positions. Parallelization is handled by \pkg{BiocParallel} for
improved performance on multiple datasets.

Missing weights (\code{NA}) are ignored during construction. Only
gene pairs matching the global gene list are inserted.

data("count_matrices")

networks <- infer_networks(
    count_matrices_list = count_matrices,
    method = "GENIE3",
    nCores = 15

wadj_list <- generate_adjacency(networks)
head(wadj_list[[1]])
