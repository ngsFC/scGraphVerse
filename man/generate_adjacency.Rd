\title{Generate Adjacency Matrices from a List of Data Frames}
\usage{
generate_adjacency(df_list, ground.truth)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_list}{A list of data frames, each containing three columns:
\itemize{
\item First column: Gene1 (character)
\item Second column: Gene2 (character)
\item Third column: Weight (numeric)
}}

\item{ground.truth}{An adjacency matrix (or data frame) with the ground truth
values, used for the dimensions and gene names of the resulting adjacency matrices.}
}
\value{
A list of adjacency matrices, one for each data frame in \code{df_list}.
}
\description{
This function generates adjacency matrices based on the information provided in
a list of data frames. Each data frame is expected to have three columns:
the first and second columns represent gene pairs, and the third column represents
the weight of the interaction between the genes. The adjacency matrices are constructed
based on these gene pairs and weights, matching the row and column names of the
provided \code{ground.truth} adjacency matrix.
}
\details{
The function creates an adjacency matrix for each data frame in \code{df_list} by placing
the interaction weights in the correct positions based on the gene pairings. The
diagonal of the resulting matrices is set to zero to ensure no self-interactions are included.

# Example data frame
df1 <- data.frame(Gene1 = c("GeneA", "GeneB"), Gene2 = c("GeneB", "GeneC"), Weight = c(0.5, 0.8))
df_list <- list(df1)
ground_truth <- matrix(0, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, dimnames = list(c("GeneA", "GeneB", "GeneC"), c("GeneA", "GeneB", "GeneC")))
