\title{Plot ROC Curves for Inferred Networks}
\usage{
plotROC(matrices_list, ground_truth, plot_title, is_binary = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrices_list}{A list of square matrices representing predicted interactions.
Each matrix must have the same dimensions and row/column names as \code{ground_truth}.
Entries may be binary (0/1) or continuous weights.}

\item{ground_truth}{A square binary matrix indicating true interactions (1) in the upper triangle.
Must match the dimensions and names of each matrix in \code{matrices_list}.}

\item{plot_title}{Character string. Title for the ROC plot.}

\item{is_binary}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, matrices are treated as binary predictions.
Default is \code{FALSE}, for weighted predictions.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each matrix.
The ROC plot is displayed automatically.
}
\description{
Computes and visualizes Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves
for a list of predicted adjacency matrices compared against a binary ground truth network.
}
\details{
For binary matrices, a single TPR/FPR point is computed per matrix.
For weighted matrices, a full ROC curve is calculated based on continuous prediction scores.
Diagonal entries are ignored. Symmetry between rows and columns is not enforced.

\examples{
mat1 <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10)
mat2 <- matrix(runif(100), nrow = 10)
ground_truth <- matrix(sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10)
diag(ground_truth) <- 0
ground_truth[lower.tri(ground_truth)] <- 0

plotROC(matrices_list = list(mat1, mat2),
        ground_truth = ground_truth,
        plot_title = "ROC for Network Inference",
        is_binary = FALSE)
}
